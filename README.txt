The program is currently limited to being a four function calculator. There is no function to constrain text within the screen. The program can do addition, subtraction, multiplication and addition. The calculator can handle decimals and negative numbers. The calculator can also do exponents. 

|| THE CALCULATOR DOES NOT IMPLEMENT ORDER OF OPERATIONS||

All calculations will be completed in a "left to right" order, and parentheses do not work.

The 2nd and alpha buttons have code that permits development for later implementation but are currently non-functional. 

Outside of the four functions, everything else is simply set up and not implemented.

The developer is hard at work to release patch 1.1 which is set to include full graphing capabilities in the cartesian plane, as well as incorporating log calculations.

Later patches should include giving functionality to every button on the calculator and implementing all functions other than matrix multiplication. The developer has a personal vendetta against matrix multiplication

Unfortunately, due to a recent PR scandal and also a general lack of funding, the developer has legal troubles and is facing various lawsuits and criminal charges. Development of the calculator program has been paused and the developer is on indefinite hiatus. The program is available on GitHub for anyone seeking to see the development process.

To contact the developer, use the email above, but it is quite unlikely that he responds.

Enjoy the clunky and inconvenient interface of this basic calculator!
